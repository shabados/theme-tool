# Contributing Code

Thank you for your interest in participating!

There are many ways to contribute, beyond writing code or programming, by: asking questions, reporting bugs, and suggesting features. To do so, please log a [new issue](https://github.com/shabados/theme-tool/issues/new).

**This document is for developers or programmers contributing to the source code.**

## Get Started

**Prerequisites**

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)

**Development**

Get the source code of `theme-tool` repo. Our recommended approach is to use the [`gh` cli tool from GitHub](https://cli.github.com/). This will fork the repo to your GitHub account (if not already), clone it to your local machine, and set the appropriate remotes for origin and upstream with the above command.

```shell
gh repo fork shabados/theme-tool --clone=true
```

Run `npm i` in the root directory.

Use `npm start` to launch Theme Tool on [port `3000`](https://localhost:3000).

## Contributing

Please see our organization docs on [contributing](https://docs.shabados.com/community/). These cover important aspects including workflow (how to submit a PR), coding guidelines (how to write a commit message), and project management (latest/next release information).
