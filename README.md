## Introduction

The Shabad OS Theme Tool is an open source project with ongoing development, project management, and marketing made possible entirely by the support and dedication of unpaid volunteers.

This web app allows users to customize and generate overlays in Shabad OS Presenter. Overlays are in sync with the presenter, so what is displayed there will also show up in the overlay. Overlays should be used in live streaming software to add gurbani and/or english, hindi, punjabi translations / pronunciations.
